# GrandPyBot

The goal of this project is to interact with a robot that would respond like our grandfather.
If we ask him for the address of a place, GrandPyBot will give it to us, of course, but not without a long and interesting story in addition.
Are you ready? Go talk to him: http://grandpybot-project.herokuapp.com
